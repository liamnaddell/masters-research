"Funding for graduate students typically covers tuition, a monthly stipend, and health benefits. Students in computer science Ph.D. programs are usually guaranteed funding for the first 1-3 years in the program. However, active graduate students making reasonable progress toward their degrees are almost always funded throughout their entire graduate education.

Financial support can come in the form of teaching or research assistantships, departmental fellowships, external fellowships, or some combination of these. The benefit of a fellowship is that you do not have to work as a TA or RA to receive this money. Fellowships give students the freedom to select any research project that interests them, rather than being limited to projects where funding is available.

External fellowship applications are usually due before graduate school applications, so it's important to start working on these early as well. This web page has a list of fellowships available to graduate students. Please note that while some awards are for current Ph.D. students only, there are awards, such as the NSF, for pursing graduate study."
