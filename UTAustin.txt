Types of programs:

A bunch of "online professional degree" BS, they offer a course masters and a thesis masters.

"Teaching assistantships are available for doctoral students.  Appointments to teaching assistantships are on a semester basis. Each semester, students in the department may submit their application to be a teaching assistant.  In addition, offers of teaching assistantships are often made at the time of admission by the admissions committee. New International TAs must satisfy an oral English Assessment conducted by the University. The Test of Spoken English does not substitute for this assessment.  A TA appointment is typically for 20 hours per week for the semester, and covers the student's tuition, fees and insurance."

Seems medium pricy, Costs including housing+transit+books+personal=20k, minus whatever TAships which ythey say cover tuition (9k). Texas resident is 17k.

Seems acceptable
